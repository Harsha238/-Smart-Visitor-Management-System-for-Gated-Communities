🏠 Smart Visitor Management System for Gated Communities
A modern web + mobile solution designed to digitize and streamline the entry process in gated communities. This project provides two dedicated portals for security guards and community administrators to manage visitor entries, approvals, and incident reporting efficiently.

🔧 Project Overview
Smart Visitor Management System eliminates the need for manual registers and spreadsheets at the gate. Instead, it empowers security guards to quickly register visitors and notifies residents for instant approval, while giving admins a centralized dashboard to monitor entries, export data, and analyze guard performance.
